## Still in development
This web application is still under development and was created in a rush to serve as an MVP for an academic project presentation.  
Although the application serves its purpose, much of the code is not well structured and will be improved, and some features are not fully implemented yet.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
