## Still in development
This web application is still under development and was created in a rush to serve as an MVP for an academic project presentation.  
Although the application serves its purpose, much of the code is not well structured and will be improved, and some features are not fully implemented yet.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## About the idea of this product
Users interested in training through courses or bootcamps often experience uncertainty and frustration when trying to choose the option that best fits their interests or professional profiles. This is due to the wide variety of available programs, the lack of clear and personalized information, doubts about quality and genuine reviews, and concerns about the relationship between cost and the value of the training for their future careers.  
The idea for the application arose from the need of IT students to find short courses and programs online, in a situation where the most relevant search results are often ads or the same old websites, which provide unclear information and create overly high expectations.
